# [`neighbors`](https://owncloud.gwdg.de/index.php/s/MlypXN3t5XUhvZJ)
## Description
Identify target and neighbor genomes for marker discovery.
## Introduction
Genetic markers are genomic regions that are common to a set of target
organisms and absent from all other organisms. This absence is often
tested by running marker candidates against comprehensive sequence
databases like [GenBank](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genbank/). Any
hit outside the targets is interpreted as cross-reactivity and
removed. However, for large candidate sets a search of
[GenBank](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genbank/) can be time
consuming. It is also not necessary, as evolution tells us the vast
majority of cross-reactive material is contained in the targets'
closest phylogenetic neighbors. The programs in `neighbors` help
identify the target and neighbor genomes listed in the current
assembly reports of
[GenBank](ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genomes/ASSEMBLY_REPORTS/assembly_summary_genbank.txt),
and
[RefSeq](ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genomes/ASSEMBLY_REPORTS/assembly_summary_refseq.txt). If
a genome is listed in both data sources, `neighbors` picks the RefSeq
accession.

Given a sample of target genomes and a sample of neighbor genomes
discovered with `neighbors`, the regions common to the targets that
are absent form the neighbors are good marker candidates. The program
[`fur`](https://github.com/evolbioinf/fur) is one example of a program
for identifying such regions. Once found, the sensitivity and
specificity of the marker candidates can quantified using, for
example, the programs in [`prim`](https://github.com/evolbioinf/prim).

## Make the Programs
If you are on a Ubuntu system like Ubuntu on
[wsl](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install) under
MS-Windows or the [Ubuntu Docker
container](https://hub.docker.com/_/ubuntu), you can clone the
repository and change into it.
```
git clone https://github.com/evolbioinf/neighbors
cd neighbors
```

Then install the additional dependencies by running the script
[`setup.sh`](scripts/setup.sh).

`bash scripts/setup.sh`

Make the programs.

`make`

The directory `bin` now contains the ten executables of the
package. Put them somewhere in your `PATH`. Additional scripts are in
`scripts`.

The
[documentation](https://owncloud.gwdg.de/index.php/s/MlypXN3t5XUhvZJ)
comes with a tutorial. To work through it, additional programs need to
be installed. Again, on Ubuntu you can run the script
[`setupTutorial.sh`](scripts/setupTutorial.sh).
```
bash scripts/setupTutorial.sh
```
## Run Docker Container 
As an alternative to building `neighbors` from scratch, we also post it as a [docker
  container](https://hub.docker.com/r/itsers/neighbors). The container
  includes all programs needed to work through the tutorial in
  [`neighborsDoc.pdf`](https://owncloud.gwdg.de/index.php/s/MlypXN3t5XUhvZJ).
```
docker pull itsers/neighbors
docker container run --detach-keys="ctrl-@" -h neighbors -it itsers/neighbors
```
## Make the Docker Container
The command
```
make docker
```
starts building a local copy of the docker image.
