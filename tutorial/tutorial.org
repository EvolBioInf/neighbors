  \section*{Introduction}
  The Neighbors package provides tools for finding the target and
  neighbor genomes used to identify regions that are ubiquitous in the
  targets and absent from the neighbors. These target regions are good
  starting material for constructing diagnostic markers. In this
  tutorial I demonstrate the application of most of the ten programs in
  the Neighbors package listed in Table~\ref{tab:pro}. We begin by
  constructing a local relational database from the taxonomy and genome
  data supplied by the NCBI using the program \ty{makeNeiDb}. Then we
  query the database with \ty{taxid} to find the taxon-ID for our target
  organism, \emph{Leginoella pneumophila}, a bacterial pathogen that
  causes pneumonia in humans. The programs \ty{ants} and \ty{dree} allow
  us to explore the taxonomic context of our target organism. Based on
  the target taxon-ID, we carry out the search for target and neighbor
  genomes using \ty{neighbors}.

  Any genomes suggested by \ty{neighbors} are best subjected to
  phylogeny reconstruction before we extract marker candidates from
  them. The prerequisite phylogeny reconstruction is done with
  \ty{phylonium}\footnote{\ty{https://github.com/evolbioinf/phylonium}}. The
  resulting tree can be very large and its analysis is supported by four
  additional programs from the Neighbors package, \ty{land} for labeling
  the nodes, \ty{pickle} for picking a particular node, \ty{fintac} for
  finding the target clade, and \ty{climt} for climbing the phylogeny
  from a given node. Once we have settled on the target and neighbor
  genomes, markers are extracted from them with
  \ty{fur}\footnote{\ty{https://github.com/evolbioinf/fur}}.

  I occasionally cite run times to give readers an idea of how long a
  step may take. I made these measurements on my run-of-the-mill laptop
  with 16 12th Gen Intel i7 CPUs and 32\,MB memory running WSL under
  Windows11.

  \section*{Construct Database}
  A dump of the current NCBI taxonomy database is posted as a tar ball at
  \begin{verbatim}
  <ftp>/<path1>/taxdump.tar.gz
  \end{verbatim}
  where \ty{ftp} is \ty{ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov} and \ty{path1} is
  \ty{pub/taxonomy}.  The corresponding assembly reports for genbank and
  refseq are posted at
  \begin{verbatim}
  <ftp>/<path2>/assembly_summary_<source>.txt
  \end{verbatim}
  where \ty{path2} is \ty{genomes/ASSEMBLY\_REPORTS} and \ty{source} is
  either \ty{genbank} or \ty{refseq}.  The database dump and the
  assembly reports are updated regularly. To ensure the stability of
  this tutorial, we use files downloaded on 28th April 2025:
#+end_src
#+begin_src sh <<db.sh>>=
  wget owncloud.gwdg.de/index.php/s/sNVcgHAkc1JHVPq/download \
       -O neidb_280425.tgz
#+end_src
#+begin_src latex
  We unpack the database files, delete the tar file, and change into the new
  directory \ty{neidb\_280425}.
#+end_src
#+begin_src sh <<db.sh>>=
  tar -xvzf neidb_280425.tgz
  cd neidb_280425
#+end_src
#+begin_src latex
  We now construct the taxonomy database, \ty{neidb}, with
  \ty{makeNeiDb}. This takes less than a minute. Then we move the
  database to the parent directory and return there.
#+end_src
#+begin_src sh <<db.sh>>=
  makeNeiDb
  mv neidb ../
  cd ../
#+end_src
#+begin_src latex
  We don't need the files from which we built the database any more, so
  we might as well delete them.
#+end_src
#+begin_src sh <<db.sh>>=
  rm -r neidb_280425*
#+end_src
#+begin_src latex
  \section*{Query Database}
  The next step is to find the taxon-IDs for our target organism,
  \emph{Legionella pneumophila}, the type strain of which is \emph{L.
  pneumophila subsp. pneumophila str. Philadelphia 1}. For this we use
  \ty{taxi}, which takes as input the name of an organism and returns
  its taxon-ID. The full strain name is a bit inconvenient to type, so
  we look for a distinctive substring. Since all \ty{taxi} queries are
  case insensitive, we try ``philadelphia 1'', which gives us a single
  hit with the type strain's taxon-ID, 272624.
#+end_src
#+begin_src sh <<query.sh>>=
  taxi "philadelphia 1" neidb
#+end_src
#+begin_src latex
  \begin{verbatim}
  # ID      Parent  Name
    272624  91891   Legionella pneumophila...Philadelphia 1
  \end{verbatim}
  We can look at the ancestors of our type strain using \ty{ants}. The
  result in Table~\ref{tab:pic} suggests that we should be targeting the
  subspecies \emph{pneumophila}, with taxon-ID 91891.
  \begin{table}
    \caption{The taxonomic ancestors of \emph{Legionella pneumohila
      subsp. pneumophila str. Philadelphia 1.}}\label{tab:pic}

#+end_src
#+begin_src latex
  To get the neighbors of a given target, we visit its parent. So let's
  use the program \ty{dree} to draw the tree rooted on our target's
  parent, the tree for the species \emph{L. pneumophila} with taxon-ID
  446.
#+end_src
#+begin_src sh <<query.sh>>=
  dree 446 neidb
#+end_src
#+begin_src latex
  The drawing returned by \ty{dree} is in dot notation. This can be
  rendered with the program \ty{dot}, which is part of the graphviz
  package available from most package repositories. The user can chose
  the format of the graphics generated by \ty{dree}, we use the Unix
  graphics format, x11. Figure~\ref{fig:446}A shows the result, where
  the nodes associated with one or more genome sequences are colored.

  By default, \ty{dree} labels nodes with taxon-IDs. We can change this
  to taxon names using the \ty{-n} option.
#+end_src
#+begin_src sh <<query.sh>>=
  dree -n 446 neidb | dot -T x11
#+end_src
#+begin_src latex
  If we are only interested in taxa with genomes, we rerun \ty{dree}
  with \ty{-g} to get Figure~\ref{fig:446}B, where the terminal white
  nodes of Figure~\ref{fig:446}A have been dropped.
#+end_src
#+begin_src sh <<query.sh>>=
  dree -g 446 neidb | dot -T x11
#+end_src
#+begin_src latex
  We can further restrict the output of \ty{dree} to genomes assembled
  to one or more of four possible assembly levels---complete,
  chromosome, scaffold, or contig---in that order of quality. Let's just
  show taxa with genomes assembled to levels complete or chromosome. The
  result is the much smaller tree in Figure~\ref{fig:446s}, where the
  three subspecies that make up \emph{L. pneumophila}, \emph{pascullei},
  \emph{pneumophila}, and \emph{fraseri}~\cite{bre88:leg}, are marked
  with abbreviated subspecies names.

      \emph{fraseri} (\emph{fr}).}\label{fig:446s}

  Instead of merely marking the presence of absence of genomes by
  presence or absence of color, we can list the individual nodes of the
  taxonomy with the counts of the associated genomes. Some of these
  genome counts are quite large, starting with the 6,768 genomes
  associated with the species \emph{Legionella pneumophila}. The
  distribution of genome counts becomes clearer when we sort according
  to it.

  We can again restrict the list to genomes assembled to levels complete
  or chromosome. Now there are 138 genomes available for the species
  \emph{L. pneumophila}, as shown in the first row of
  Table~\ref{tab:gen}. The remaining entries in that table refer to
  taxonomic levels below the species level, most notably the three
  subspecies we already singled out on the taxonomic tree,
  \emph{pneumophila} with 20 genomes, \emph{fraseri} with 9 genomes, and
  \emph{pascullei} with 6.
  \begin{table}

  The 20 genomes for subspecies \emph{pneumophila} do not include the
  genomes in the five sequenced taxa below subspecies, which are easy to
  see in the taxonomic tree in Figure~\ref{fig:446s}, and make up the
  five last lines in Table~\ref{tab:gen}.

  Row 6 of Table~\ref{tab:gen} contains another
  \emph{subsp. pneumophila} strain, taxon 933093. However, it is a
  descendant of taxon 66987 instead of the appropriate subspecies, taxon
  91891 (Figure~\ref{fig:446s}). When we list the ancestors of that
  stray \emph{subsp pneumophila} strain, we can see that its parent
  belongs to Serogroup 12. This serogroup is, in fact, synonymous with
  \emph{pneumophila}~\cite[Table~6]{bre88:leg}, but this is not apparent
  from the taxonomy, so beware.

  In summary, our target taxon has 25 genomes, its neighbors 22, giving
  a total of 47 genomes. This leaves the 138 genomes only classified to
  species level unaccounted for. They should belong to one of the three
  subspecies, but this classification beyond the species level has
  evidently not been made in these cases. To still use all
  \emph{L. pneumonia} genomes available, we carry out two analyses. In
  the first we analyze the 47 targets and neighbors at the subspecies
  level. We call this the ``small'' analysis to distinguish it from the
  subsequent ``large'' analysis that also includes the 138 species
  genomes.
  \section*{Small Analysis---Genomes in Subspecies Only}
  We begin by creating the directory \ty{small} and changing into it.
#+end_src

#+end_src
#+begin_src latex
  We use \ty{neighbors} to find the genomes for our target and its

  assembled to level \emph{complete} or \emph{chromosome} (\ty{-L}).

  \end{verbatim}
  I've edited the output of \ty{neighbors} above and also of other
  programs throughout this tutorial for clarity and to fit the printed
  page. The output begins with three hashed lines. The first states the
  most recent common ancestor of the targets, \emph{L. pneumophila
  subsp. pneumophila}, with taxon-ID 91891. The second line states the
  most recent common ancestor of the neighbors \emph{and} the targets,
  \emph{L. pneumophila} with taxon-ID 446. The third line is the header
  of the subsequent table, which consists of four columns, type,
  taxon-ID, name, and genomes. There are three possible types, ``t'' for
  known target, ``tt'' for new target, and ``n'' for neighbor.

  To download the target and neighbor genomes, we need the genome
  accessions. These are a bit tricky to extract from the current
  ``report view'' of the \ty{neighbors} results. So we use the ``list
  view'' instead. It consists of three columns, sample with t for target
  and n for neighbor, accession, and taxon-ID.

#+end_src
#+begin_src latex
  We use the program
  \ty{datasets}\footnote{\ty{https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/datasets/}}
  provided by the NCBI to download the genomes. We exclude genomes
  flagged as ``atypical'' and download the genomes in ``dehydrated''
  form, starting with the targets, which we save in \ty{tdata.zip}. We
  get 23 genomes, which means 2 of our 25 target accessions were flagged
  as ``atypical''.

  To remind us that the final division into targets and neighbors is
  still pending, we move all 45 genomes into a common directory,
  \ty{all}. We begin with the targets. To help us later divide the data
  into true, i. e. phylogenetic, targets and neighbors, we prefix the
  names of the target genomes with \ty{t}.
#+end_src
#+begin_src sh <<small.sh>>=

  do

      mv $a all/t$b
  done
#+end_src

We also move the neighbor genomes into \ty{all} and mark their names
with prefix \ty{n}.
#+end_src
#+begin_src sh <<small.sh>>=

  done
#+end_src
#+begin_src latex
  We've now got the taxonomic targets and neighbors united in directory
  \ty{all}, distinguishable by their prefixes t or n. Our next task
  is to extract from this data the phylogenetic---as opposed to
  taxonomic---targets and neighbors. We do this by calculating a
  distance-based phylogeny from all genomes. We calculate the requisite
  distances using the program
  \ty{phylonium}\footnote{\ty{https://github.com/evolbioinf/phylonium}}
  and save them in \ty{lpn.dist}. This takes about 17\,s.
#+end_src
#+begin_src sh <<small.sh>>=
  phylonium all/* > lpn.dist
#+end_src
#+begin_src latex
  We convert the distances to a neighbor-joining tree with \ty{nj} and
  midpoint root it with \ty{midRoot}. Both programs are part of the
  biobox\footnote{\ty{https://github.com/evolbioinf/biobox}}. Then we
  label the internal nodes of the phylogeny with \ty{land}, which is
  part of Neighbors, and save the final tree in \ty{lpn.nwk}.
#+end_src
#+begin_src sh <<small.sh>>=
  nj lpn.dist | midRoot | land > lpn.nwk
#+end_src
#+begin_src latex
  The tree in \ty{lpn.nwk} is in the popular Newick format for
  phylogenies\footnote{\ty{https://phylipweb.github.io/phylip/newick\_doc.html}},
  and you can render it with your favorite tree plotting program. One
  example of such a program is \ty{plotTree} from the biobox. At this
  point, the taxon names consist of prefix t or n followed by accession
  numbers. These are a bit tedious to read, so we remove them to just
  leave the single-character prefix before plotting the tree to give
  Figure~\ref{fig:lpn}, with added annotations for the three subspecies
  \emph{pneumophila}, \emph{fraseri}, and \emph{pascullei}.

  In Figure~\ref{fig:lpn} the subspecies are given, but not on the raw

  first of all observe that node 16 contains all targets, so it is
  presumably \emph{subsp. pneumophila}. To annotate the two remaining
  clades rooted on node 2, we look for a leaf from one of the two
  remaining subspecies, say \emph{fraseri}. However, leaves are labeled
  by file name without any taxon information, which is included in the
  header lines inside the sequence files. We list both the file name and
  the header line by calling \ty{head} on all input files. Then we
  filter for \emph{fraseri}, which we output together with the
  corresponding file name in the preceding line. We restrict our output
  to the first two lines containing the first hit.

  We climb from the \emph{fraseri} accession we just found,
  \ty{GCA\_003003865}, toward the root using \ty{climt} in regex

  To further explore this hypothesis, we check the headers of the
  accessions in clade 8 and find that they all belong to \emph{fraseri}.

  This implies that clade 3 is \emph{pascullei}, and if we check the

  \emph{pascullei}.

  We can see in Figure~\ref{fig:lpn} that the target clade, node 16, has
  a number of taxonomic neighbors sprinkled in. We can count these seven
  taxonomic neighbors using the program \ty{pickle} (Neighbors).

Since all annotated subspecies are in the right place on the
phylogeny, these seven taxonomic neighbors in the target clade must
belong to the taxa outside the subspecies in
Figure~\ref{fig:446s}. There are six such taxa, 297245, 297246,
400673, 423212, 866628, and 933093. Table~\ref{tab:gen} shows that
with the exception of taxon 866628 they contain one genome each, taxon
866628 contains two genomes. In other words, all seven stray genomes
outside the three canonical subspecies in Figure~\ref{fig:446s} belong
to subspecies \emph{pneumophila}.

We follow the phylogeny and call everything inside clade 16 a
target. In Figure~\ref{fig:lpn} it is easy to pick the target clade by
eye. However, in densely sequenced taxa the number of targets and
neighbors is often so large as to render the resulting tree
illegible. In such a situation we can still find the target clade
using the program \ty{fintac} (Neighbors). As expected, it picks clade
16 from our example tree, and reports that this clade contains all 23
taxonomic targets and the 7 taxonomic neighbors we just counted
directly. According to equation~(\ref{eq:spl}), this ratio of targets
and neighbors leads to a split of
\[
s(v)=\frac{23+22-7}{45}\times 100\approx 84\,\%.
\]
The parent of node 16 is node 1, the root. The branch connecting node
16 to the root has length 0.025, one of the longer branches in
Figure~\ref{fig:lpn}.

  We begin our search for markers by splitting our genomes into targets,

  \section*{Large Analysis---All \emph{L. pneumophila} Genomes}
  As we already saw at the beginning of this tutorial,
  Table~\ref{tab:gen} contains 138 genomes only associated with the
  species \emph{L. pneumophila}. In other words, there are three times
  more genomes than the 45 we analyzed so far still awaiting
  analysis. And while they haven't been classified among the three
  subspecies, perhaps we can still make use of them. So our plan is to
  add these 138 genomes as ``unknown'' to the analysis in the hope that
  the distribution of known taxonomic targets and neighbors will allow
  us to also divide the unknowns into targets and neighbors, thus making
  use of all data available.

  We make the directory \ty{large} and change into it.
#+end_src
#+begin_src sh <<large.sh>>=
  mkdir large
  cd large
#+end_src
#+begin_src latex
  We run \ty{neighbors} using as target the species
  \emph{L. pneumophila}, taxon-ID 446 (Table~\ref{tab:pic}. We save the
  unknown accessions in \ty{uacc.txt}.
#+end_src
#+begin_src sh <<large.sh>>=
  neighbors -t 446 -l -L complete,chromosome ../neidb |
      grep '^t' |
      awk '{print $2}' > uacc.txt
#+end_src
#+begin_src latex
  The program  \ty{neighbors} returns  the accessions of  all qualifying
  genomes in the taxonomy rooted on a given taxon. So we expect
  \ty{uacc.txt} to contain the 138 accessions associated with taxon 446
  plus the 47 target and neighbor accessions already analyzed, yielding
  a total of 185 accessions.
#+end_src
#+begin_src sh <<large.sh>>=
  wc -l uacc.txt
#+end_src
#+begin_src latex
  Since we already dealt with 47 of the 185 accessions in the small
  analysis, we subtract the target and neighbor accessions from that
  analysis from \ty{uacc.txt}. We begin with the 25 taxonomic target
  accessions and make sure we retain $185-25=160$ accessions.
#+end_src
#+begin_src sh <<large.sh>>=
  grep -v -f ../small/tacc.txt uacc.txt > tmp.txt
  wc -l tmp.txt
  mv tmp.txt uacc.txt
#+end_src
#+begin_src latex
  Similarly, we subtract the 22 taxonomic neighbor accessions in
  \ty{nacc.txt} from \ty{uacc.txt} and make sure we retain $160-22=138$
  accessions, the 138 accessions listed for taxon 446 in
  Table~\ref{tab:gen}.
#+end_src
#+begin_src sh <<large.sh>>=
  grep -v -f ../small/nacc.txt uacc.txt > tmp.txt
  wc -l tmp.txt
  mv tmp.txt uacc.txt
#+end_src
#+begin_src latex
  We download the unknown accessions in dehydrated form and exclude
  atypical genomes. We get a full complement of 138 dehydrated genomes,
  so none of our accessions refers to an atypical genome. We save these
  genomes in \ty{udata.zip}.
#+end_src
#+begin_src sh <<large.sh>>=

	   --inputfile uacc.txt \
	   --exclude-atypical \

  We unzip the unknown genomes into the directory \ty{udata}.
#+end_src
#+begin_src sh <<large.sh>>=

#+end_src
#+begin_src latex
  We rehydrate the genomes.
#+end_src
#+begin_src sh <<large.sh>>=
  datasets rehydrate --directory udata
#+end_src
#+begin_src latex
  We copy the directory \ty{all} from the small analysis, move the
  unknown genomes into it, and mark them with prefix u.
#+end_src
#+begin_src sh <<large.sh>>=
  cp -r ../small/all .
  for a in udata/ncbi_dataset/data/*/*.fna
  do
      b=$(basename $a)
      mv $a all/u$b
  done
#+end_src
#+begin_src latex
  We make sure directory \ty{all} contains the expected 183 genomes.
#+end_src
#+begin_src sh <<large.sh>>=
  ls all | wc -l
#+end_src
#+begin_src latex
  We calculate the pairwise distances between the genomes and save them
  in \ty{lpn.dist}. This takes 14\,s.
#+end_src
#+begin_src sh <<large.sh>>=
  phylonium all/*.fna > lpn.dist
#+end_src
#+begin_src latex
  We convert the distances into a neighbor-joining tree, midpoint root
  it, and label its nodes. Then we saved the tree in file \ty{lpn.nwk}.
#+end_src
#+begin_src sh <<large.sh>>=
  nj lpn.dist | midRoot | land > lpn.nwk
#+end_src
#+begin_src latex
  In our tree the targets should be rooted on the node that maximizes
  the number of taxonomic targets inside and the number of taxonomic
  neighbors outside while ignoring the unknowns. We could try looking
  for this manually, but this is difficult as our tree contains 183
  taxa. Instead, we run \ty{fintac} specifying prefix n as the neighbor
  mark and ignoring the messages that warn about taxa that are neither
  target nor neighbor. This returns the same 84\,\% split as before,
  with an almost identical branch length to the parent, 0.025. This is
  reassuring. Our target clade in the large tree is labeled 25.

  Sprinkled among the taxonomic targets and neighbors are unknowns. To

  As summarized in Table~\ref{tab:sum}, by including the 138 species
  genomes, we expanded the target set from 30 genomes to 159 genomes and
  the neighbor set from 15 to 24 genomes. Markers are found by
  subtracting the neighbors from one target and intersecting the result
  with all other targets~\cite{vie24:mar}. This means that an increase
  in the number of genomes analyzed, irrespective of whether they are
  targets or neighbors, can never lead to an increase in marker
  material. Instead, we usually observe a decrease. Still, in spite of
  our increase in size of the target and neighbor set, we ended up with
  6.4\,kb candidate sequences, plenty for marker construction.

  \begin{table}
    \caption{Summary of ``small'' and ``large'' analysis of diagnostic
      markers in \emph{L. pneumophila}.}\label{tab:sum}

      \end{tabular}
    \end{center}
  \end{table}

  The next steps in the design of diagnostic markers would be to make
  PCR primers based on \ty{lpn.fasta}. We would then test \emph{in
  silico} the specificity and sensitivity of these primers. The package
  Prim\footnote{github.com/evolbioinf/prim} contains programs for primer
  construction and assessment. Any primers derived from this \emph{in
  silico} work would ultimately need to be tested \emph{in vitro} to
  make sure they are diagnostic for \emph{L. pneumophila
  subsp. pneumophila}.

  As a final step, we return to the parent directory.
